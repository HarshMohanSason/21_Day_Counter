# 21 Day Counter

## Description

The 21 Day Counter is a program designed to track whether a guest has stayed 21 days or more at a property. Once a guest reaches their 21st day, the program sends a notification as a reminder. The system stores all guest information in a local SQLite database, ensuring data persistence and easy access.
